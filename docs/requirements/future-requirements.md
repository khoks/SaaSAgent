## Entries

### [2026-04-26] Proactive agent that pops up unprompted
**Source:** Initial vision dump from Rahul.
**Category:** capability
**Notes:** Future state — agent decides on its own when the user needs attention or when there is a next-best-action. Requires: continuous insight into host SaaS service catalog, attention-budget engine, confidence gating. To be groomed under FR-P.

### [2026-04-26] Mobile app embedding (parity with web)
**Source:** Initial vision dump from Rahul.
**Category:** capability
**Notes:** Adobe, Canva, Expedia, Best Buy, Walmart, Shopify all have native mobile apps. Platform must work in mobile contexts, not only web. Native SDK? React Native? WebView bridge? — open.

### [2026-04-26] AI-native stores for time-windowed behavior queries
**Source:** Initial vision dump from Rahul.
**Category:** capability
**Notes:** "What was the user doing in the past 2 minutes / 10 minutes / week / year?" Requires purpose-built stores beyond traditional event logs. Architecture-level decision pending.

### [2026-04-26] Cross-session memory of solutions accepted vs. rejected
**Source:** Initial vision dump from Rahul.
**Category:** capability
**Notes:** Memory tracks not just what was said, but which suggestions the user took, which they ignored, and which they pushed back on. Drives personalization and trust calibration over time.

### [2026-04-26] Universal agent surface across an entire app/OS ecosystem (Google-style)
**Source:** Rahul Q1 answer 2026-04-26: "I would have liked to anchor the design for something like the google's app/OS ecosystem, but that is like the ultimate use case."
**Category:** vision
**Notes:** The end-state aspiration: a single agentic substrate operating not inside one host SaaS but **across every app and surface a user touches** (think: Google's app + OS ecosystem — agent that knows your Gmail, Calendar, Maps, Photos, Drive, Android state simultaneously, with cross-app memory and orchestration). MVP is the single-host-embedded model; design today should not foreclose the multi-host future. Implications for: cross-app identity, federated memory, cross-host workflow orchestration, app-discovery protocol.

### [2026-04-26] Federated cross-enterprise learning (opt-in)
**Source:** Implied by ADR-006 self-hosted decision; raised in conversation 2026-04-26.
**Category:** capability
**Notes:** Self-hosted distribution kills cross-customer telemetry by default. Future opt-in mode: enterprises can contribute anonymized pattern data (planner traces, composition templates, skill-usage statistics) to a federated learning pool, in exchange for receiving aggregated improvements. Privacy-preserving (DP / federated aggregation). Strictly opt-in, off by default. Avoids the "self-hosted means no product feedback loop" trap.

### [2026-04-26] Auto-extraction of host design system from existing artifacts
**Source:** Implied by ADR-005; raised in conversation 2026-04-26.
**Category:** capability
**Notes:** Host design-system registration is manual at MVP. Future: auto-extract from Storybook (CSF), Figma design tokens, component metadata files, MDX docs. Reduces onboarding friction substantially.

### [2026-04-26] Cached composition templates per recurring intent
**Source:** Implied by ADR-005 architecture; raised in conversation 2026-04-26.
**Category:** capability / optimization
**Notes:** The UI Composer LLM step is per-turn. For recurring intents (e.g., "show product comparison"), the composed JSON layout tree should be cacheable and reused with new data wiring. Saves model spend and reduces latency.
